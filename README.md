WEB APIs:
Web APIs are specifically used over the internet using HTTP or HTTPS protocols. The front-end can communicate with the database using WEB APIs i.e. RestFull APIs.
Library APIs:
Library APIs are the APIs that have function definitions hidden. Only specific methods are exposed so that users can utilize the library easily, without understanding the complexity of it.
Prompting and Completion:
Prompting means providing the input to the AI model to get the desired result. It can be a question or instruction.
Completion means the AI model responds with the processed result of the input. The result depends upon the training and algorithms of the AI model.
